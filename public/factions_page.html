    <h1>Toronto Accord</h1>
    <p class="factionText">Britain, forced to cut ties with a Europe now under Nazi domination, turned across the Atlantic to America as its closest ally, the two fighting side by side against Japan in Asia along with their Commonwealth allies. The result was the Toronto Accord, a formal alliance built by the remaining powers of the democratic west, standing for collective security, democracy and human rights and as a united front against the threat of Nazi Germany.

    <h1>Mediterranean Pact</h1>
    <p class="factionText">Formed around the Italian Empire at the peak of its power after Axis victory in the European Wars, the Mediterranean Pact focuses on maintaining hegemony over the Mediterranean Sea, making the faction more militaristic with romanticised ideals of a Roman Empire at its core. The Mediterranean Pact also serves as a counter balance to Nazi Germany's control over Mainland Europe.
