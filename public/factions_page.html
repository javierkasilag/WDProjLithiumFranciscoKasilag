    <p class="infoboxText">Britain, forced to cut ties with a Europe now under Nazi domination, turned across the Atlantic to America as its closest ally, with the two along with their Commonwealth allies fighting side by side against Japan in Asia. The result of his cooperation was the Toronto Accord, a formal alliance built by the remaining powers of the democratic west, standing for collective security, democracy, and human rights. The alliances serves as the largest and most united front against the looming threat of Nazi Germany.
    <br><br>
    The Accord's influence dominates the Americas, Africa, and parts of maritime Asia, which hold most of its member nations and their colonies, including a host of governments-in-exile. However, it is struggling in continental Europe and Asia, wherein it is contested by powers such as Germany, Italy, and even the rising China. While it has the economic, military, and nuclear advantage over the rest of the world, the Accord has adopted less destructive geopolitical measures, from supplying resistance groups to rapid military interventions. Through this, it is ultimately playing the long game by contributing to the instability of powers like the Reich, so that, when they are weak enough, the forces of the West can come in to restore liberty and hope to oppressed nations around the world.

    <img src="assets/NewOrder_image.jpg" alt="Poster of Die Neue Ordnung" style="width: 800px;" class="factionImage">
    <p class="infoboxText">Die Neue Ordnung, or the New Order in German, was never formed as an official faction, but serves as a term for Germany's direct sphere of influence, with partners that be cooperating closely with the Nazi regime. The starting members of the Neue Ordnung are all German controlled puppet governments, with their sole purpose within this unofficial faction being to enrich metropolitan Germany with each subject's local resources. Through this, Germany hopes to achieve its ambitions of a greater Germanic empire, one purified for the Aryan race which must lord over the rest of the world.
    <br><br>
    Spanning from Brittany in France all the way to the Astrakhan-Arkhangelsk Line near the Ural Mountains, the Neue Ordnung possesses a chokehold over most of Europe, save for its former allies in the Mediterranean as well as the unconquered British Isles. The Greater Germanic Reich makes up most of the faction's territory; besides Germany and its colonies, the faction's members are made up of various puppet states and allies which can only depend on the Reich for their survival. As wide as it stands and as powerful as it is, the Neue Ordnung is fraught with domestic issues, including continued partisan resistance in occupied territories, internal squabbling over the organization and policies of the Reich, and economically demanding megaprojects. Thus, it is more occupied with internal stability and development over active expansion.

    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Mediterranean Pact</h1>
    <img src="assets/MediterraneanPact_image.jpg" alt="Poster of the Mediterranean Pact" style="width: 800px;" class="factionImage">
    <p class="infoboxText">Formed around the Italian Empire at the peak of its power after the victory of the Axis Powers, the Mediterranean Pact is focused on maintaining Italian hegemony over and interests in the Mediterranean Sea—the Pact's namesake—with militaristic and romanticised ideals of a new Roman Empire at its core. The Mediterranean Pact serves as a counterbalance to Nazi Germany's fanatical control over mainland Europe, as well as the encroachment of Western liberalism. With idealistic hopes of restoring Rome and eventually conquering its enemies, Italy with its allies stand against the rest of the world.
    <br><br>
    Although surrounded by factions of superior power, with the Neue Ordnung in the north and the Accord in the south and west, the Mediterranean Pact composes a vital geographic, economic, and strategic crossroads, encompassing territories ranging from the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa to most of the Balkans. The Italians are jousting with the Germans and the West for sway over various regions, especially the Middle East, the only major part of the Mediterranean which the Pact does not strongly control. The faction's interests are mostly that of survival, due to its relatively weak position. The Italian Empire, commanding all of its client states and partners, is focused on building up its regional development and strength to assert itself independently on the world state, although it runs the risk of alienating the rest of the Pact precisely because of this self-interest.
