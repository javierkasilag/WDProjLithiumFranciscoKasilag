    In this age, nuclear technology was vastly expanded and improved, with the development of the first hydrogen bomb by the USA, quickly followed by the Greater German Reich. Hydrogen bombs have a more explosive/destructive capacity compared to the atomic bomb due to their increased blast radius, amongst other factors. Additionally, nuclear power plants were being constructed in the Midwest and in core German land in order to commercialize nuclear energy and to be more energy independent. This would bring more economic prosperity & independence to the European countries in exile in Africa, such as Belgium and France, as shortly after World War 2, uranium and other “nuclear” elements were discovered in those countries in exile. As a result of this, the United States imported these nuclear elements, also helping in the construction of mines and railroads, in order to bring the materials from the interior and into the coast, where they were shipped to US-controlled harbors.

    Commercial aviation would become incredibly in demand in all parts of the developed world. The British, with the aid of the Americans, created de Havilland Comet, the first jet airliner to cross the Atlantic Ocean. After 7 years, the USA created the first commercial Boeing 707; its larger fuel section allowed for long-distance travel, having a maximum travel distance of 6,700km or 3,600 nautical miles. In the field of rockets and jets, the Americans launched the Redstone Rocket and the Vanguard Rocket mainly for the purposes of testing and attempts at satellite launch. Meanwhile, the Germans developed the Amerika Bomber and the Silbervogel, which were capable of doing transcontinental strikes/bombings. Both the Germans and the Americans would have the technology to create supersonic jets, which they did, with America creating the North American F-100 Super Sabre, and the Germans creating the Messerschmitt Me 400.

    The 1950s marked the start of the First and Second generations of modern computing. At the time, computers were primarily used by the military, scientists, or the government. Computers at the time used vacuum tubes as the main electrical component; these tubes were highly inefficient and big, which made early computers extremely bulky and power-hungry. These computers, while inefficient, were revolutionary at the time as they were able to do calculations in a fraction of the time that humans would take doing it. Computers, such as the ENIAC which was developed by America, were used for calculating artillery calculations.

  <p class="infoboxText">
    The 1950s were a period when communication became faster, more centralized, and strategic, especially for military and state control. Long-distance radio networks were created, but were only used for military purposes, such as military commands and overseas communication. Additionally, landlines, radios, and payphones were expanded and made cheaper, which resulted in a large majority of homes having access to a phone and a radio. Meanwhile, surveillance also had major advancements with the creation of radio intercept stations, which monitored military transmissions and radar emissions. Additionally, early forms of air radar were being developed, but were still in a prototype phase. Early suborbital rockets carried cameras and sensors, which were supposedly used for missile detection and the like.
