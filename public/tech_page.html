        <h2>Nuclear Technology</h2>
        <p>
          In this age, nuclear technology was vastly expanded and improved, with the development of the first hydrogen bomb by the USA, quickly followed by the Greater German Reich. Hydrogen bombs have a more explosive/destructive capacity compared to the atomic bomb due to their increased blast radius, amongst other factors. Additionally, nuclear power plants were being constructed in the Midwest and in core German land in order to commercialize nuclear energy and to be more energy independent. This brought more economic prosperity & independence to European countries in exile in Africa, such as Belgium and France, as uranium and other nuclear elements were discovered there. The United States imported these elements, helping in the construction of mines and railroads to bring the materials to US-controlled harbors.

        <h2>Jet and Rocket Aviation</h2>
        <p>
          Commercial aviation became increasingly in demand worldwide. The British, aided by Americans, created the de Havilland Comet, the first jet airliner to cross the Atlantic. Seven years later, the USA created the Boeing 707; its larger fuel capacity allowed for long-distance travel of up to 6,700km (3,600 nautical miles). Rockets and jets advanced rapidly: Americans launched the Redstone and Vanguard Rockets for testing and satellite attempts, while Germans developed the Amerika Bomber and Silbervogel capable of transcontinental strikes. Both nations achieved supersonic flight with the F-100 Super Sabre and Messerschmitt Me 400.

        <h2>Early Computing</h2>
        <p>
          The 1950s marked the start of the first and second generations of modern computing. Computers were primarily used by the military, scientists, and governments. Vacuum tubes made computers bulky and power-hungry, but revolutionary for calculations, performing tasks far faster than humans. Machines like ENIAC in the USA handled artillery calculations and other complex computations.

        <h2>Communications & Surveillance</h2>
        <p>
          Communication became faster and more strategic. Long-distance radio networks existed mainly for military use, while landlines, radios, and payphones were made widely accessible. Surveillance advanced with radio intercept stations monitoring military transmissions and radar emissions. Early air radar prototypes and suborbital rockets carrying cameras and sensors were also developed for reconnaissance and missile detection.
