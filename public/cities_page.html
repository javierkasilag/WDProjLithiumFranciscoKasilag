    <b>Berlin</b> serves as the seat of the Nazi regime, being the largest and most populous city in all of the Greater Germanic Reich. It is the central point of the Neue Ordnung, serving as the primary administrative capital of Germany by housing everything from economic districts to the party offices of the NSDAP. A stroll around the city yields the intimidating and brutalistic sight of swastikas, sprawling buildings, propaganda, and statues of political figures in all corners. Whether it be the Brandenburg Gate as a symbol of victory, or the under-construction Volkshalle planned to show the Reich's eternal strength, Berlin imposes Nazi might upon itself and the rest of Europe. The German government is carrying out its ambitious but costly plans to transform Berlin into the Welthaupstadt Germania, a metropolis envisioned to rival and exceed the great ancient cities belonging to Egypt, Babylon, Rome, and others.

    <b>Rome</b> stands as Italy's center of imperial—indeed, Roman—power. An established city of historical significance, it is less cosmopolitan than other European cities, although it is nevertheless rapidly modernizing; ancient strutures like the Colosseum and Mausoleum of Augustus are accompanied by newly-erected fascist architecture, from the PNF's political and propagandic headqurters in Piazza Venezia to the olympic Foro Mussolini. Unfortunately for those in Rome, the Italian Empire is not too economically well-off, so bulldozed roads and houses have amounted to less than what the fascist government has planned. However, Rome can still boast of its many ports and agricultural spaces alongside a bustling ideological tourism industry. Although one might think it to be eclipsed by the imposing Berlin or the prosperous New York City, Rome is nonetheless the mighty center of the Mediterranean Sea, both geographically and geopolitically, wherein an assortment of maritime trade, diplomacy, and politicking occurs, around which the Italian Empire hopes to restore a greater Roman Empire.

    <img src="assets/Paris_image.jpg" alt="Paris" style="float: left; margin-right: 30px; width: 800px;" class="cityImage">
    <p class="infoboxText">
    <b>Paris</b>, once known as the "City of Light" for its beauty and prosperity before the Second World War, now remains under the chokehold of the Neue Ordnung. While formally still part of France, it is nowhere as vibrant as it was under the independent French Republic—its scenes of artists, intellectuals, and fashionistas have been either expelled or co-opted by the French State to appease its Nazi overlords, while its economy is being siphoned for the sake of German economic interests. Landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame, and Arc de Triomphe have been turned into marvelous sights for Reich officials to behold, adorned with the Reich's triumphant symbols. For the Parisians themselves, they either live as traitorous collaborators or suffer under post-war conditions worsened by Paris' rapid transformation into a mere satellite city. Besides cells of the French resistance who are being snuffed out by Nazi police, it looks bleak for not just the city but all of France.

    <p class="infoboxText">
    <b>London</b> remains the battered capital of a surviving Great Britain, partly bombed to the ground yet remaining a symbol of Western resistance to Nazi hegemony. Due to the British leading the Allies in the European theater of the Second World War, It was a prime target for German air raids, damaging all sorts of significant places within the city, from Buckingham Palace and Westminster to the Houses of Parliament. Just ten years after the end of the war, the economy and development of London remains in shambles, with hundreds of thousands of poor and displaced Londoners, alongside reconstruction efforts being continually slowed by Britain's lack of trade with and geopolitical isolation from the rest of Europe. However, the parts of the city that have survived continue to do so, becoming signs of national hope via their service as bases for reconstruction and preparation for possibly more impending conflicts on the world stage, especially with Germany next-door.

    <p class="infoboxText">
    <b>New York City</b>, situated on the border of the Atlantic Ocean west of the Old World, is the preeminent hub of prosperity and liberty of the United States, largely unscathed by the conflicts of Afro-Eurasia but affected by consequences nonetheless. It serves as one of the main centers of the Toronto Pact, where American factories, shipyards, and many more productive facilities contribute to the West's power and stability against the encroachment of other nations comprising factions like the Neue Ordnung and Mediterranean Pact. The city hosts a variety of areas that serve symbolic, cultural, and socioeconomic purposes, including the bustling businesses of Wall Street, the corporate offices housed in the Empire State Building, and the Statue of Liberty which watches over NYC—these are relatively stable and quickly progressing even with the encroaching threats coming from outside the American continent. NYC does also have its own assortment of problems, mainly concerning how its urbanization is swallowing up the lives of New Yorkers and allowing crime to fester in its underbelly, but it is comparatively less bleak than most of the world.

    <p class="infoboxText">
    <b>Tokyo</b> was once the proud throne of Japan's imperial government, but is now under Western domination. During the war, it housed the imperial government, critical industries, transportation hubs, and military facilities, among other things, centered around the Imperial Palace wherein the emperor resides. Unfortunately for the Japanese, many of these structures were damaged or even destroyed by sustained bombings from the Allies, even if Tokyo was spared of the atomic bomb—as a result, the city's atmosphere remains gloomy and somewhat impoverished. With that said, unlike other cities conquered by the Germans or Italians, American and British forces have refrained from doing any seriously damaging resource extraction or colonizaion of Tokyo, as with the rest of Japan, due to its strategic importance as the Toronto Pact's base of operations in East Asia; landmarks like the Meiji Shrine and Tokyo National Museum remain untouched, due to the West's disinterest in forcibly transforming an already Western-friendly city.

    <p class="infoboxText">
    <b>Nanjing</b>, quite ignored by the rest of the world, is the slowly growing capital of the rising Republic of China. It was unfortunately brutalized by the Empire of Japan over the course of the war, with the imperial Japanese army torching and looting its way across not just the city but most of Western China, with this damage being worsened by Sino-Japanese military engagements over the course of seven years. However, with the Japanese now pacified by the Toronto Pact, the Chinese government has taken great efforts to rebuild and develop its capital city. Nanjing boasts many structures displaying Eastern strength and wisdom, including the Presidential Palace serving as the headquarters of the Kuomintang government, the Zhonghua Gate symbolizing China's defensive power, and the Nanjing Fuzimiao housing Confucian places of education. Although hundreds of thousands of Chinese still remain injured and displaced in subpar conditions, China hopes to turn the city into an Eastern stronghold.
