    <b>Berlin</b> serves as the seat of the Nazi regime, being the largest and most populous city in all of the Greater Germanic Reich. It is the central point of the Neue Ordnung, serving as the primary administrative capital of Germany by housing everything from economic districts to the party offices of the NSDAP. A stroll around the city yields the intimidating and brutalistic sight of swastikas, sprawling buildings, propaganda, and statues of political figures in all corners. Whether it be the Brandenburg Gate as a symbol of victory, or the under-construction Volkshalle planned to show the Reich's eternal strength, Berlin imposes Nazi might upon itself and the rest of Europe. The German government is carrying out its ambitious but costly plans to transform Berlin into the Welthaupstadt Germania, a metropolis envisioned to rival and exceed the great ancient cities belonging to Egypt, Babylon, Rome, and others.

    <b>Rome</b> stands as Italy's center of imperial—indeed, Roman—power. An established city of historical significance, it is less cosmopolitan than other European cities, although it is rapidly modernizing nonetheless; ancient strutures like the Colosseum and Mausoleum of Augustus are accompanied by newly-erected fascist architecture, from the PNF's political and propagandic headqurters in Piazza Venezia to the olympic Foro Mussolini. Unfortunately for those in Rome, the Italian Empire is not too economically well-off, so bulldozed roads and houses have amounted to less than what the fascist government has planned. However, Rome can still boast of its many ports and agricultural spaces alongside a bustling ideological tourism industry. Although one might think it to be eclipsed by the imposing Berlin or the prosperous New York City, Rome is nonetheless the mighty center of the Mediterranean Sea, both geographically and geopolitically, wherein an assortment of maritime trade, diplomacy, and politicking occurs, around which the Italian Empire hopes to restore a greater Roman Empire.

    <p class="infoboxText">
    <b>Paris</b>, once known as the "City of Light" for its beauty and prosperity before the Second World War, now remains under the chokehold of the Neue Ordnung. While formally still part of France, it is nowhere as vibrant as it was under the independent French Republic—its scenes of artists, intellectuals, and fashionistas have been either expelled or co-opted by the French State to appease its Nazi overlords, while its economy is being siphoned and de-industrialized for the sake of German economic interests. Landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame, and Arc de Triomphe have been turned into marvelous structures for Reich officials to behold, adorned with the Reich's triumphant symbols. For the Parisians themselves, they either live as traitorous collaborators or suffer under post-war conditions worsened by Paris' rapid transformation into a mere satellite city. Besides cells of the French resistance who are being snuffed out by the Nazi police, there is little hope for not just the city but all of France.

    <p class="infoboxText">
    <b>London</b> remains the battered capital of a surviving Great Britain, partly bombed to the ground yet remaining a symbol of Western resistance to Nazi hegemony. Due to the British leading the Allies in the European theater of the Second World War, It was a prime target for German air raids, damaging all sorts of significant places within the city, from Buckingham Palace and Westminster to the Houses of Parliament. Just ten years after the end of the war, the economy and development of London remains in shambles, with hundreds of thousands of Londoners impoverished and displaced, alongside reconstruction efforts being continually slowed by Britain's lack of trade with and geopolitical isolation from the rest of Europe. However, the parts of the city that have survived continue to do so, becoming signs of national hope via their service as bases for reconstruction and preparation for possibly more impending conflicts on the world stage, especially with Germany next-door.
