### Description:
This website is about the lore of Thousand Week Reich (TWR), an alternate history scenario about Germany winning World War 2 made for the real-time strategy (RTS) game called Hearts of Iron 4 (HoI4). On the webpage, users can explore an interactive map of the world during that era. By clicking or hovering over a specific region or country, a  GUI panel appears, giving detailed information about that area,  including its military status, political system, economics, cultural developments,  recent history, etc. Additionally, the site will have information about key figures and power blocs or spheres of influence that help users better understand the current timeline of the scenario, with all its alliances, conflicts, and ideologies. There will also be visual media, such as simulations and possibly news broadcasts/papers, during that era to improve the user’s immersion into said scenario.
